# 🧾 Bushra's Bazaar

**Bushra's Bazaar** is a C++ object-oriented inventory management system that simulates a mini-market setup. It allows users to manage products such as **tobacco** and **lottery tickets** through a modular and scalable design using class inheritance, file I/O, and clean architecture.

---

## ✨ Features

- Product class hierarchy: `Product`, `Tobacco`, `LotteryTickets`
- Inventory tracking via `InventoryManager`
- File I/O with `Inventory.txt`
- Terminal-based interaction and testing
- Designed for modularity and scalability

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Inheritance and Encapsulation
- C++ File Input/Output (fstreams)
- Clean class structure and separation of concerns
