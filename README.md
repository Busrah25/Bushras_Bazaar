# Bushra's Bazaar

A C++ object-oriented inventory management system developed in Xcode. The application simulates a mini-market system for managing products like **tobacco** and **lottery tickets**, using class inheritance, file I/O, and modular design.

## 🛠 Features
- Product class hierarchy: `Product`, `Tobacco`, `LotteryTickets`
- Inventory management with `InventoryManager`
- File I/O using `Inventory.txt`
- Terminal-based testing
- Designed for modularity and scalability

## 💡 Key Concepts
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Inheritance and Encapsulation
- C++ File Input/Output
- Clean class structure and separation of concerns
